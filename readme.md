# @paperdave/ui

My own ui library for making svelte applications. It has these keys:

- Polished and good feeling to interact with, with the extreme attention to detail I am known for.
- Easily themeable and customizable, beyond dark and light modes.
- Simplistic and small, but large enough to cover most needs.
- "Modern" and "Fast", but those words are thrown around too much

Its overall style can be described as a "Less Corporate" version of Material Design, with my own design ideals thrown in. We use simple LCH-based palettes over their HCT tonal ones.

Components are built using Stencil, which exports them as web components, to be used in any framework, such as Svelte, React, Vue, Raw HTML, etc.
